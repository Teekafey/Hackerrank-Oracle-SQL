Write a query identifying the type of each record in the __TRIANGLES__ table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- __Equilateral__: It's a triangle with **3** sides of equal length.

- __Isosceles__: It's a triangle with **2** sides of equal length.

- __Scalene__: It's a triangle with **3** sides of differing lengths.

- __Not A Triangle__: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
  
__Input Format__

The __TRIANGLES__ table is described as follows:


Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

__Sample Input__


__Sample Output__

```

```

__Explanation__

Values in the tuple __$(20, 20, 23)$__ form an Isosceles triangle, because __$A \equiv B$.
